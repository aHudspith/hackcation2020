# Where's WiT?

My project for MLH Hackcation 2020

Published at <https://ahudspith.github.io/wheres_wit/>

This is my project for the MLH Summer League Hackcation

### What

I have decided to make a Where's Wally/Waldo style game based around Women in Tech
I have used HTML, CSS and JS for this project.

### Why

I am really passionate about Women in Tech, and helped to found the WiT society at my uni.
I am also very aware that in order to increase the number of WiT we need to start with getting more girls into tech!
I thought that creating a game to teach young girls about awesome WiT would help to inspire them.
I have also been wanting to experiment with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library for a while now as a fan of [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com). With the theme of Hackcation being to take a break, I thought I'd take a break from my day-to-day coding work and take the time to learn something new just for fun!

### How

This is my first time using JS for more than just a form on a webpage and is my first time using the p5.js library.

I created a GitHub repo for my project and created the blank README.md, index.html, styles.css and sketch.js files. I was then able to populate these files with the generic structure to start making a p5.js project.

To publish my project I made use of GitHub pages which is a quick and free way to publish straight from a GitHub repo.

I created the avatars for the game using [Vectornator](https://www.vectornator.io) which is a free Mac and iOS app for graphic design.

### What next

At the moment the code is very basic and the game is the same each time.

I want to continue this project by:

-   creating more avatars
-   including more WiT
-   making the scenes randomly lay themselves about
